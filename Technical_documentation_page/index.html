          <h3>Introduction</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) form the backbone of computer science and software engineering. Put simply, data structures are ways of organizing and storing data to perform operations efficiently, while algorithms are step-by-step procedures for solving computational problems. In essence, DSA provide the essential tools and techniques for handling and manipulating data effectively, enabling developers to write efficient code and solve complex problems in programming and software development.<p>
          <p>Following are reasons why understanding Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is important:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Efficiency: DSA knowledge enables developers to write code that utilizes resources optimally, resulting in faster and more responsive software.</li>
            <li>Problem-Solving Skills: Proficiency in DSA enhances developers' ability to tackle complex problems systematically, breaking them down into manageable components and devising elegant solutions.</li>
            <li>Scalability: DSA are essential for building scalable software systems that can handle increasing user demands and large datasets, ensuring performance and responsiveness as the user base grows.</li>
          </ul>
        <p>Example of a simple algorithm:</p>
        <pre><code>// Simple algorithm to find the sum of an array
function sumArray(arr) {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    sum += arr[i];
  }
  return sum;
}
console.log(sumArray([1, 2, 3, 4])); // Outputs: 10

          <h3>Data Structures</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Data structures are formats for organizing and storing data in a computer's memory. They facilitate efficient data manipulation and access. Examples include arrays, linked lists, and trees.</p>
        <h4>Arrays</h4>
        <p>Arrays are data structures that store a collection of elements in contiguous memory locations. They offer fast access to elements based on their index. Array properties include fixed size and homogeneous data types. Common operations on arrays include accessing elements using index notation, inserting elements at specific positions, and deleting elements by shifting subsequent elements.<p>
          <p>Examples of array usage include storing lists of integers, characters, or objects. Common algorithms involving arrays include sorting algorithms like bubble sort and searching algorithms like linear search.</p>
          <pre><code>// Declaring and initializing an array
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(numbers[2]); // Outputs: 3
</code></pre>
        <h4>Linked Lists</h4>
        <p>Linked lists are linear data structures consisting of nodes, each containing a data element and a reference to the next node in the sequence. Types of linked lists include singly linked lists, where each node points to the next node, doubly linked lists, where each node points to both the next and previous nodes, and circular linked lists, where the last node points back to the first node, forming a loop. Linked lists offer dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion and deletion operations, but they lack direct access to elements and have slower traversal compared to arrays.</p>
        <p>Operations on linked lists include insertion, where a new node is added at a specified position, deletion, where a node is removed from the list, and traversal, where all nodes are sequentially accessed and processed. Insertion and deletion operations involve adjusting node references to maintain the list's integrity.</p>
        <p>Linked lists are preferred over arrays in situations where frequent insertion and deletion operations are required, as they have constant-time complexity for these operations. They also offer flexibility in memory allocation, enabling efficient use of memory resources. However, linked lists have slower access times compared to arrays since elements must be traversed sequentially, making them less suitable for random access or applications requiring frequent element access by index.</p>
        <pre><code>// Node class for a linked list
class ListNode {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.next = null;
  }
}
</code></pre>
        <h4>Stacks and Queues</h4>
       <p>Stacks and queues are both abstract data types (ADTs) commonly used in computer science for managing collections of elements with specific access and processing rules.</p>
        <p>Stacks:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Characteristics: Stacks follow the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle, meaning the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. They have two main operations: push (to add an element to the top of the stack) and pop (to remove the top element).</li>
          <li>Real-World Applications: Stacks are widely used in computer science and everyday life. For example, the call stack in programming languages tracks function calls and returns, undo operations in text editors, and managing browser history.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Queues:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Characteristics: Queues follow the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle, where the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed. They have two primary operations: enqueue (to add an element to the back of the queue) and dequeue (to remove the front element).</li>
          <li>Real-World Applications: Queues are commonly used in scenarios where items are processed in the order they arrive, such as task scheduling in operating systems, print queues in printers, and waiting lines in customer service.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Trees</h4>
        <p>A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. It is used to represent hierarchical relationships among data elements.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Nodes: The individual elements of the tree.</li>
          <li>Edges: The connections between nodes.</li>
          <li>Root: The top node of the tree.</li>
          <li>Leaf: Nodes with no children.</li>
          <li>Subtree: A tree consisting of a node and its descendants.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Types of Trees</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Binary Tree: Each node has at most two children (left and right).</li>
          <li>Binary Search Tree (BST): A binary tree where the left child contains only nodes with values less than the parent node, and the right child contains only nodes with values greater than the parent node.</li>
          <li>AVL Tree: A self-balancing binary search tree where the difference in heights between the left and right subtrees of any node is at most one.</li>
          <li>Red-Black Tree: Another self-balancing binary search tree with an extra bit for color (red or black) to ensure the tree remains balanced during insertions and deletions.</li>
          <li>N-ary Tree: A tree in which each node can have at most N children.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Common Tree Algorithms</p>
        <p>Insertion:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>In a binary search tree, insertion involves traversing the tree from the root to find the correct position for the new node, maintaining the BST property.</li>
          <li>In AVL and Red-Black trees, additional steps ensure the tree remains balanced after insertion.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Deletion:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Deletion in a BST involves three cases: deleting a leaf node, deleting a node with one child, and deleting a node with two children. In the last case, replace the node with its in-order predecessor or successor.</li>
          <li>AVL and Red-Black trees require rebalancing after deletion to maintain tree properties.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Searching:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>In a BST, search by comparing the target value with the current node, moving left or right accordingly until the value is found or the subtree is null.</li>
          <li>In AVL and Red-Black trees, search operations are similar but ensure balanced trees, providing O(log n) time complexity.
</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <pre><code>// Binary tree node class
class TreeNode {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.left = null;
    this.right = null;
  }
}
</code></pre>
        <h4>Graphs</h4>
        <p>A graph is a versatile data structure used to represent relationships between pairs of objects. It consists of nodes, also known as vertices, and edges that connect these nodes. Graphs can be either directed, where edges have a specific direction, or undirected, where edges have no direction. They can also be weighted, with edges having associated weights, or unweighted, with edges having no weights.</p>
        <p>Graphs can be directed or undirected, with edges either pointing in one direction or both, respectively. They can also be weighted, where edges have associated costs, or unweighted. Traversal techniques like Depth-First Search (DFS) explore deeply before backtracking, while Breadth-First Search (BFS) explores level by level, useful for shortest paths in unweighted graphs. Key algorithms include Dijkstra's for shortest paths in weighted graphs, and Prim's and Kruskal's for finding minimum spanning trees, with A* using heuristics for efficient pathfinding in navigation systems.</p>

          <h3>Algorithms</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems and performing tasks. They are fundamental in computer science and programming, providing systematic methods for data processing, calculations, and automated reasoning. Algorithms are designed to be efficient in terms of time and space, ensuring optimal performance for various computational tasks.<p>
        <h4>Sorting Algorithms</h4>
        <p>Sorting algorithms arrange elements in a particular order (ascending or descending). Common sorting algorithms include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Bubble Sort: Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.</li>
          <li>Merge Sort: Divides the array into halves, sorts each half, and merges them back together.</li>
          <li>Quick Sort: Picks a pivot element, partitions the array around the pivot, and recursively sorts the partitions.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre><code>// Quick sort implementation
function quickSort(arr) {
  if (arr.length <= 1) return arr;
  let pivot = arr[Math.floor(arr.length / 2)];
  let left = arr.filter(x => x < pivot);
  let right = arr.filter(x => x > pivot);
  return [...quickSort(left), pivot, ...quickSort(right)];
}
console.log(quickSort([5, 3, 8, 4, 2])); // Outputs: [2, 3, 4, 5, 8]
</code></pre>
        <h4>Searching Algorithms</h4>
        <p>Searching algorithms find specific elements within a data structure. Common searching algorithms include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Linear Search: Sequentially checks each element until the target is found or the end is reached.</li>
          <li>Binary Search: Efficiently searches a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Graph Algorithms</h4>
        <p>Graph algorithms solve problems related to graph data structures. Common graph algorithms include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Dijkstra's Algorithm: Finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.</li>
          <li>Prim's Algorithm: Finds the minimum spanning tree of a weighted graph by building the tree one edge at a time.</li>
          <li>Kruskal's Algorithm: Also finds the minimum spanning tree, but starts with all nodes as individual trees and merges them.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Dynamic Programming</h4>
        <p>Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant work. Common dynamic programming problems include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fibonacci Sequence: Computes the nth Fibonacci number by storing previously computed values.</li>
          <li>Knapsack Problem: Determines the maximum value that can be obtained from items with given weights and values, without exceeding a weight limit.</li>
          <li>Longest Common Subsequence: Finds the longest sequence that can be derived from two sequences by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.</li>
        </ul>
